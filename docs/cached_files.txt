General
=======

Information on the sqlite database file format. There is a single
table to record events, but depending on the type of the row it may
contain a coordinate event or a log event. Coordinate events are
triggered by the hardware. Log events indicate important app status
changes and they may help to define why the log may have less entries
(eg. the application entered into the background).


Log table
---------

**id** INTEGER PRIMARY KEY:
	Identifier of the log entry in the database. This identifier
	is unique and always autoincrementing.
**type** INTEGER:
	Identifier of the event type. Available events are:
	 * 0: Log entry
	 * 1: Hardware GPS event in foreground app.
	 * 2: Hardware GPS event in background app.
**text** TEXT NULL:
	Optional text field entry. Usually not null when the type
	of event is a log entry. Otherwise not used.
**longitude** REAL:
	Stores the longitude of a geodetic coordinate in decimal format.
**latitude** REAL:
	Stores the latitude of a geodetic coordinate in decimal format.
**h_accuracy** REAL:
	Stores the horizontal accuracy of the reading in meters.
**v_accuracy** REAL:
	Stores the vertical accuracy of the reading in meters.
**altitude** REAL:
	Stores the altitude of the reading in meters. Usually
	negative if not available.
**timestamp** INTEGER:
	Timestamp of the reading.
